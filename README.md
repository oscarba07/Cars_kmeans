# Cars_kmeans
This project uses data regarding car accidents in the US from https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/bad-drivers to train a K-means model and classify US' states according the incidence of car accidents.

In the process, PCA is done and the elbow algorithm is replicated to identify the number of clusters.

This exercise could is an example of how a transit policy could use this information to design different policies for different states.
